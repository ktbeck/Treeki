# Treeki

The Journaling app to rule them all. 

The problem with today's journaling apps is that in order to see your evolution as a human, you need to read entire entries upon entries from the past. 

With **Treeki** this is no longer a problem! Our app will ask you a random question every day of the year, and the question will repeat every year.
In this way, you can see how your answers change every year and how you evolve as a person. Of course, on top of this, you can also use the app as a normal diary app.

We have also included a friends list so that you can share your answers/journals with your friends!
